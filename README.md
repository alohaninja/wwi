# Stuff to know

This is not in any particular order.



1. If you’re new to Google, my [Tips for Nooglers](http://go/tips-for-nooglers) might be helpful
2. I generally work ~8.30am–~5.30pm MT, and then ~10pm–~12am MT. The time in between I aim to reserve for me and family.
    1. that’s me. you do you.
    2. late-night email isn’t in general expected or desired.
    3. my family? A wife who teaches yoga; two daughters, 6 and 8
3. If you receive an email from me at night then the right interpretation is “because Isaac is doing work on his schedule” rather than “Isaac wants an answer right now”
    4. same with chats/IMs
4. I mostly don’t care if your email processing schedule aligns with mine or not
    5. If I need your attention on something with tremendous urgency, I’ll not be expecting you to find that out by checking your email (corollary: you’ll not be missing any massively urgent things by not checking your email at night.)
5. Sign up for                                 (                                     ). it’s pretty great, and you should help exercise it.
6. I believe in “clean” downtime, as in: time off where you go firmly offline work-wise. Make sure you spend enough of your vacation days this way; it’s valuable, healthy, and important.
    6. if you plan to declare email bankruptcy on your return, make sure to let people know via your OOO message
7. Artifacts with URLs are good. Aim to create shared artifacts rather than ephemeral undiscoverable messaging trails
    7. any email chain >500 words suggests that a document should be created
    8. any group chat conversation >50 posts long suggests that a document should be created
8. I believe in the [Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) (urgency/significance). Be aware that not everything you’re asked to do Urgently is actually Significant; and that there is Significant non-Urgent stuff which nobody is bugging you for. Prioritize accordingly.
9. I also believe in the [Impact/Effort matrix](https://hunterwalk.com/2016/06/18/the-best-startups-resists-snacks-im-not-talking-about-food/), and that you have to be constantly vigilant as to where you’re spending your effort. Resist the lure of low-effort but low-impact work
    9. Note that work can be moved vertically up on this matrix by making it reusable.
10. It’s important to meet in person every now and then with the people you work with. Aim to travel to sit down with colleagues in sibling sites SVL/NYC/BLD from time to time, and probably at least once each quarter. When you’re traveling, also aim to meet in person with people you’re organizationally adjacent to but maybe don’t work closely with.
11. I recommend that you make a list of the stuff which needs doing, and plot it (even notionally) on the urgent/significant and the impact/effort matrix. Stack rank it, and don’t worry if stuff further down on this list doesn’t get done.
    10. There will always be stuff which doesn’t get done; the trick is make sure it’s the right stuff not to get done :)
12. If you’re overloaded, please holler and we’ll together work out what stuff can not get done. If you need my help with anything, similarly please holler. I’m invested in your success.
13. I highly recommend that you reserve some time on your calendar for “thinking and creating time” and defend it aggressively. On my own calendar I’ve blocked out Tue/Wed/Thu afternoons. I wholly sacrifice Monday and Friday for meetings, and don’t expect to get much thinking or creating done those days.
    11. “thinking and creating time” isn’t a time for email! Use it to work on that strategy deck you’ve been meaning to get to, or that PRD that’s been languishing, ways to increase team velocity, or to think about work themes for next quarter
    12. “thinking and creating time” is for working on bigger thoughts which can’t be squeezed into the gaps in a series of meetings
14. Our team uses Asana to track high-level tasks for me and other team members. Order it from go/stuff and prepare to [have your life changed](https://twitter.com/isaach/status/897479250646794242)
    13. see go/using-asana for how we use it
15. Remember that unless you’re really explicitly given a hard requirement (or assigned to a task in Asana) most things asked of you should be treated as _input_ into your prioritization process. This goes even for direction given by your manager: my default approach is to treat my manager as a stakeholder in my work, and my job is to weigh and balance the needs of _all_ the various stakeholders, my boss included.
16. I’ll be aiming to talk with you about your career every now and then—to jointly check in on your trajectory, desires, ambitions, and so on. This can be as often as you like at your option, but if you don’t bring it up at all then I will :)
17. Read “I like, I wish, I wonder” (go/like-wish-wonder), and read [the original](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20131017224857-6488620-i-like-i-wish-i-wonder). It’s a great generally useful feedback framework. Use it to give feedback; use it to solicit feedback.
18. I hold myself strictly to the principle that one’s Docs/Sheets/Slides should be open for commenting across google.com unless there’s a really good reason.
    14. good reason: protecting the confidence of a partner/customer/colleague
    15. good reason: the document includes personnel information (perf data, upcoming org change, HC planning, anything HR-related)
    16. poor reason: forgot to change the sharing settings
    17. poor reason: can’t imagine anybody else would be interested in this doc
    18. poor reason: the doc’s not finished yet
19. Amongst other things I value decency, honesty, straightforwardness, dependability, and presence
    19. call me out straight away if I miss the mark on any of these.
20. Ask me anything. Seriously.
